# Legislative
Stay up to date on current bills hitting the house and senate floors

##Synopsis
Legislative is an autonomous web application that graphically visualizes all the bills approaching congressional floor for debate or vote. We hoped by keeping the application highly visual, it would make it easier to grasp legislative progress quickly and profoundly.

##How It Works
This application uses Node.js and MongoDB, as well as the [Sunlight Labs](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) API, which gives us access to all bills and their details in almost real-time.

As we wanted to focus on upcoming bills, we pulled all the bills scheduled to approach the floor that week and gathered additional data using the API. In order to keep it up to date, we have the application make a call to the API everytime the page is loaded.

All the graphs are generated based on the data we retrieve and package.
